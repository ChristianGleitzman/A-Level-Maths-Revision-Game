# A Level Maths Pyramid Traversal Revision Game

## Overview

This project is my A-level computer science coursework, in which I developed an interactive Maths Integration and Differentiation revision game. The application uses a combination of client and server-side Python programs, as well as a central server database to store user data and questions. The client-side program utilises the PyQt5 library to create a visually engaging and user-friendly interface for login, main menu, and question answering. The game features an immersive pyramid-like structure, where users progress by correctly answering questions. I implemented this feature using the pygame library. The server program handles various requests from connected clients with the help of the 'socket' Python library, such as login requests, fetching questions, and saving user performance data to the server database.

## Libraries Used

- Pygame
- PyQt5
- Socket

## Outcomes

This project provided me with valuable experience in working with stakeholders, designing and implementing a program and relational database from the ground up, utilising and understanding a variety of Python modules, applying theoretical concepts learned in computer science classes in a practical setting, making modifications to the program based on feedback, thorough testing and debugging, and using problem-solving skills to find solutions.

The end result was a program that achieved its purpose of helping students at my school practice their Maths, with many finding it to be a useful tool in their revision process. I also achieved a 100% mark on the coursework which I am very proud of and rewarded the effort & determination involved in completing this ambitious project.
